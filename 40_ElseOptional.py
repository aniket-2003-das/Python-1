a = int(input("enter your number"))

# 1. If else ladder


if(a<3):
     print("the value of a less than 3")
elif(a<7):
     print("the value of a is less than 7")
elif(a<13):
     print("the value of a is less than 13")
elif(a<17):
     print("the value of a is less than 17")

# Hence we conclude that else is an optional conditional.
